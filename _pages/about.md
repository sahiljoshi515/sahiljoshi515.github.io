I am a first-year Ph.D. student advised by [Dr. Anshumali Shrivastava](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~as143/) with a research focus on efficient training of large language models and their applications. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Prior to starting my Ph.D., I gained two years of industry experience as a Software Engineer at Dell Technologies. Beyond work, I’m passionate about travelling around the world, getting immersed in gripping thriller/horror shows, and staying active by playing table tennis competitively.
