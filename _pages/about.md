I am a first-year Ph.D. student with a research focus on Large Language Models and their applications. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Prior to starting my Ph.D., I gained two years of industry experience as a Software Engineer at Dell Technologies. Beyond work, I’m passionate about exploring new places around the world, getting immersed in gripping thriller shows, and staying active by playing table tennis.
